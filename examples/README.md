### NOTE: This is a very rough example â€” Do not copy this

It has the *wrong* include paths, some of the includes are *nonexistent*, and it uses some other libraries which may be different from the ones you are using.
I only included this example because the `render()` function demonstrates how to use this library, so basically just ignore everything else around it.
