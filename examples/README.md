### THIS IS A VERY ROUGH EXAMPLE; DO NOT COPY THIS

It has the *wrong* include paths, some of the includes are *nonexistent*, and it uses GLFW.
Honestly, this was more for me, to preserve my work on this test file.
I only included this because the render() function shows how to use this library, so just ignore everything else around it.
I plan on fixing this later, I promise I'm not actually a messy person irl.
